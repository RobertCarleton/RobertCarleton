## Robert Carleton

**Games Developer (Programmer/Amimator/Musician)**

I'm a Third Year Student attending ATU Sligo here in Ireland. Over the course of my study I have gained a lot of insights and skills to Games and Software Development, ranging from learning languages like C# and C++ to complex structures such as that of Data Structures and Algorithms. Before my course, I was an avid gamer playing a variety of games, both casual and competitive. I've been an avid researcher and experimented with Game Design for many years before I began my journey through college, roughly about 9 or 10 when I began my adventure into programming using Scratch, and later advanced to using Blender and Unity. Most recently, I've been using Unreal Engine and am currently using it as a Base Engine for my final year project!

  <summary><h3> Robert's Coding Journey </h3></summary>
  <summary><h4>Inspiration - Playing Games</h4></summary>
  As a young kid I became vastly interested with video games. Whenever I was at a cousin's house I was always playing their Wii, or felt left out when everyone was on their DS's (I only got mine when I was 7). I loved playing multiplayer games of that age like Mario Kart Wii or solo adventures like Super Mario Galaxy, or even competitive games like Super Smash Bros. (one of my personal favourite series). Of course, as I grew up, I went beyond the world of Nintendo and played a variety of other games on Xbox, laptop, etc such as Halo, Minecraft, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and even Fortnite (had terrible Wifi until June 2024 and back in 2018 playing fortnite at 15fps on a laptop with the high ping was not fun :D ) 
  <br><br>I had a gap from gaming for a good year or so, where I pursued my musical interests on piano, which led to me achieving a Higher Achiever Award from The Royal Irish Academy of Music in 2018. Eventually, in my mid teens I went back to the Nintendo side of things with the Switch, where games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate immediately got me back into the swing of gaming after the break (I actually played competitive in Smash Bros. for a while, even managing to land every last character in Elite Smash[Ranked], something even the best players would have yet to achieve). Many new adventures such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild attracted me to more open world games and even the Zelda series in general. From my own personal projects and ideas, Breath of the Wild is likely the largest influence in my open world creativity, whilst the likes of Mario Galaxy would be more - literally - out of this world intentions in game design. Of course we suffered a Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020, which for me was a 6 month holiday because I was just in transition year at the time. Games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons got me really back into a good mindspace admist the isolation, which really has taught me the power of marketing games to the right players at the right time, since for one it's very enjoyable and also that it blew up 40m+ sales in its lifetime. 
  <br><br>Moving past Nintendo yet again, I worked during the pandemic and saved up money for a Gaming PC, which I built from scratch, just finished building the week before Bitcoin took off which is a real sign of luck considering the prices trippled for Graphics Cards almost instantly. Of course aside from Game Development I played online games with friends, such as GTA, Minecraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty, etc. I also took the opportunity to play single player adventures such as Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade and Eldin Ring. These Games have phenomenal combat systems which I have taken note from for my own projects. At the minute, I am occasionally playing some Fortnite, plan to go back to Red Dead Redemption II (which I began in August), and play a bit of Wii Sports with my College roommates. Unfortunately with assignments, projects and just life, it's hard to find the balance of gaming amongst that, so the small free time I get to game is what counts most for me :)


  <summary><h4>Coding Adventure - Where it all Began</h4></summary>
  Around the age of 8 years old, my family and I attended a Video Game Festival in Dublin. It was there I learned about Scratch. Eventually, when I was maybe 9 or 10, I began my journey using the website, making fun games and animations, and communicating with other young programmers. I believe to have learned this scriptable programming language within a year. I even entered a programming competetion representing my primary school in which I made a platform game where you had to get pieces of Candy to progress through a level. It was pretty fun and everybody really enjoyed playing my creation.
  <br><br>Fast forward a couple years, I was maybe 12 or 13? I started using Blender on my laptop and creating models and character creation. It is a very difficult tool to became industry standard in, but I was able to create some creative scenes that looked incredible. When we used Maya in our Second Year of the course, I found it very easy and I actually aided my peers in teaching them to use it, since the shortcuts for Maya aren't as user-friendly as Blender. I really enjoy messing around and coming up with abstract/unique character designs in Blender.
  <br><br>Not too long after my Blender adventure began, I installed Unity. I was actually rather overwhelmed at first, maybe for the guts of a year before my brother and I finally started using it for our own games. We messed around with the idea of platformers for a long time, though I was set on making a Level based adventure game with some platforming physics (which I have reconsidered to an open world). We got some interesting things created at the time, such as a camera rail system, Wall Jumping, etc. After some time we heard about Game Jams, which are game creation challenges where a competitor must create a game within a set period of time. The usual timeframe is a week, some have it a day, a few hours or some even several weeks. I've entered on my own and with my brother once or twice, and while it didn't necesarrily go my way, it surely was an experience. Perhaps its given me the skills to quickly program so I can make my programming deadlines :D Some of my work will be visible on my website (currently under development)

  
  <summary><h4>Games Programming in College</h4></summary>
  So, I started college here in Sligo in 2022. First Year for me was a breeze, programming was no problem whatsoever since I already had good experience with C#. While it was some time ago, I recall we used Unity a lot in Introduction to Games Programming. This was a really enjoyable module, perhaps my favourite module to date. It let me relearn and expand a little bit on my skills in Unity. Second Year, I was met with some modules I found difficult, such as Databases and Data Structures & Algorithms. I also gained great programming skills from modules such as Object Oriented Programming and Object Oriented Development. For the Games focused modules, we had Game Content Design(1 and 2) where we did 2D art in Photoshop, Illustrator and 3D modeling in Maya. For our Programming Modules we had 2D Games and 3D Games. We used the Monogame add-on for Visual Studio for 2D Games (and some of 3D) which essentially taught us how to build a basic game engine. Some parts were extremely difficult, whilst others were no problem for an avid C# programmer like myself. Despite the challenges, with intense studying and a LOT of work, I managed to succeed in earning my place in Third Year. 
  <br><br>So far, Third Year has been a little challenging with the likes of Rich App Development and Mobile App Development, since they expected complete fluency in Java and LINQ which us in Games weren't as fluent with, but with continuous dedication I have so far had little issue with these modules and appear to be achieving well in these modules. In terms of our Game focused modules, we only have one Game Module this semester, called Advanced Games Programming. Here we have learned C++ and Unreal Engine. I've found C++ fairly good so far since it is very similar to C# with a few but easy to spot differences. Currently, as part of our final year project (Project 300), the 4 of us remaining in Games Development are making a Game using Unreal Engine. The game follows a hero who was imprisoned by the vengeful villain in a temple 1000 years ago, and has just been freed. He must set out and free the world, restoring the fallen lands into the hands of light and out of the grasp of darkness. The combat follows similar to Devil May Cry Combat, while the World itself we settled on being Semi-Open World. You can freely explore areas and discover some hidden secrets but it follows a linear path as your Main Quest. We are still currently in development of the tutorial region, however we plan to branch out and create some more regions which gift you the power they are themed after (e.g. diseased or blood regions, etc). Development is going smoothly and hopefully I will be able to share this incredible project with you in the future :)

  <summary><h4>What does my future look like as a Games Developer?</h4></summary>
  Well, throughout my years before and during college I have gained a variety of skills in programming, and in art design and graphics. On top of that, I do have a very strong musical ability, which I have written 100s of my own musical compositions for games. I am ambitious to learn within the games development industry on the job, and would love to one day become a Games Designer, since I would have Programming, Art and Music expertise. Video Games have been a huge part of my life my my early childhood, in both playing and making them. I am sure my future will be bound to them, in a similar but more incredible way as I begin work in this fantastic industry.
